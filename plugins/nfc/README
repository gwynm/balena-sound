Looks for NFC tags on an attached reader and plays corresponding spotify context uris.


## In detail

If the currently playing context is Underoath's album "Erase Me" (https://open.spotify.com/album/7431Bc80pipMjt6v3qm0UL ; context-uri  spotify:album:7431Bc80pipMjt6v3qm0U)

  * Delete the context-uri associated with this tag ID

  * Begin playing Nihls Frahm's album "Empty".

Else if the tag ID is registered with a context-uri in the internal database:
  
  * Immediately begin playing the corresponding context-uri

Else
 
  * Associate the currently-playing spotify context uri (album, artist, or playlist), if any, to the tag. 
  
Tag data other than ID is never read, and nothing is ever written to the tag itself.

## Setup

### Environment

Expects the environment to contain:

SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=5a...b2
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=bc52...57e
SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=AQA...WYU
SPOTIFY_USERNAME=
SPOTIFY_PASSWORD=

We need the spotify user/pass so that the spotify plugin can auth directly. Else it has to wait for zeroconf auth from the phone, 
which means this won't work until after the first time you play via Spotify Connect from your phone.

### Hardware

Expects a "PN532 NFC HAT" from Waveshare (https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/PN532_NFC_HAT).
