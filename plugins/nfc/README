Looks for NFC tags on an attached reader (expecting text like `spotify:playlist:{playlist_id}`) and plays them.

Expects the environment to contain:

SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=5a...b2
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=bc52...57e
SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=AQA...WYU
SPOTIFY_USERNAME=
SPOTIFY_PASSWORD=

We need the spotify user/pass so that the spotify plugin can auth directly. Else it has to wait for zeroconf auth from the phone, 
which means this won't work until after the first time you play via Spotify Connect from your phone.
